<div>
    <h1>{{title}}</h1>
</div>

<!--Thatâ€™s it! Because we have specified the ng-view directive in our index.html, Angular will just take the HTML code from home.html and inject it in the ng-view div.

And then we just inject the title property that we added to the $scope object earlier by putting it inside our double curly braces. This is the syntax that Angular uses to inject information from the $scope object into the HTML code. -->
